					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
						Six Shooter is an in-progress VR game that I am developing
						completely on my own. The game has two modes, a target practice mode
						and a wave mode. In the target practice mode, the player can improve
						their aiming skills, while in the wave mode, the player must use
						their bullets, positioning, upgrades, and quick reflexes to survive.

						<br /><br />

						As the game is still in development, I am constantly adding new
						features and improvements to the game. I am also working on
						optimizing the game for VR, as well as adding new levels and
						enemies.

							<h4><strong>Gameplay</strong></h4>
							<p>
								The game is designed to be a hectic, action-packed, and
								challenging experience. The game is designed to be difficult,
								but fair, and encourages the player to improve their skills and
								strategies over time. With various levels, enemies, and a set of
								randomized upgrades, the game is designed to be replayable and
								engaging.

							<h4><strong>Visuals</strong></h4>
							<p>
								Currently, most of the assets are placeholders, as I am focusing
								on developing the core mechanics of the game. However, I am also
								working on creating new assets and improving the visuals of the
								game.
								<br /><br />
								Instead of trying to make the game look realistic, I am aiming
								for a PS1 aesthetic, with low-poly models a limited
								color-palette, and a low resolution. This aesthetic helps to
								give the game a unique look and feel, while also allowing me to
								create assets quickly and efficiently.

							<h4><strong>Sound</strong></h4>
							<p>
								Six Shooter has a variety of sound effects and music that help
								to immerse the player in the game. The game has a multiple
								soundtracks that play during the game, as well sound effects for
								shooting, reloading, and enemy attacks.

								<br /><br />

								All of the sound effects and music are designed to be fitting
								for the game's western theme, and help to create a cohesive and
								engaging experience.

								<br /><br />

								Additional music and sounds are planned to be added in the
								future.

					<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<p>
						One of the biggest challenges of developing Six Shooter is
						optimizing the game for VR. VR games require a high frame rate and
						low latency to be comfortable and enjoyable to play. As a result, I
						am constantly working on optimizing the game to run as smoothly as
						possible on a variety of headsets.

						<br /><br />

						Creating a game that is both challenging and fair, while also being
						engaging and replayable is a tall task, but it is one that I am
						constantly working on. The game is designed to be difficult, but it
						is important that the game is not frustrating. As a result, I am
						constantly tweaking the game's difficulty, as well as adding new
						features and mechanics to keep the game engaging and fun to play.

						<br /><br />

						With me being the sole developer of the game, I am also responsible
						for creating all of the assets, sound effects, and music for the
						game. This is a time-consuming task, but it also allows me to have
						complete creative control over the game's look and feel, resulting
						in a product that is truly my own.
